# Wnba-Success
This project combines two of my favorite things, women's basketball and data analytics. 
All the data was found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/wnba-draft-basketball-player-data-1997-2021. 
The essential question my project is answering is Does your draft pick predict how successful you will be in your career?
The factors that quantified succcess are player's total rebounds, assists, points, games played in correlation with their overall pick in their respective draft year.
I performed data cleaning and preprocessing before performing EDA(univariate and bivariate analysis) on the data before defining successScore which is the overall variable consisting of the all the factors aforementioned to show how successful a player was in respect to their draft pick. 
I then created an interactive dashboard on MicrosoftPowerBI that shows the outcomes of this project. 
The results found that higher draft picks (1 being the highest, 30 being considered a lower draft pick) tend to have higher success scores. This means players who were likely picked first, mainly ended doing better in the league, in terms of average points, rebounds, assists and games played throughout their career.
